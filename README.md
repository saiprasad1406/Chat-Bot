# Chat-Bot
The project is a Wechaty bot in Python that handles text, image, and file messages, manages room members and topics, processes friendship requests, and handles mini-program messages. Future enhancements include extending functionality, improving error handling, and implementing configuration management. Key files are `bot.py` and `simple-bot.py`.
